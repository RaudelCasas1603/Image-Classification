# Sign Language Detection
The Sign Language Gesture Recognition project utilizes Python, OpenCV, and the powerful Random Forest algorithm. It captures and preprocesses video frames, extracting hand landmarks using Mediapipe. These landmarks are then used as input for the Random Forest algorithm, trained on a labeled dataset of sign language gestures. The algorithm learns patterns and correlations between landmarks and gestures, enabling accurate real-time recognition.

# How to install it?
To install Sign Language Detection application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/RaudelCasas1603/Monky-Detection-.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd Monky-Detection-```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```shell
   python3 -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   * On macOS and Linux:
     ```shell
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
   * On Windows:
      ```shell
      .\env\Scripts\activate
      ```
5. Install the package program:
   ```shell
   pip install .
   ```
That's it! You have now successfully installed the Sign Language Detection application.

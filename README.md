# Capuchinbird calls detection
## Table Of Contents


# Description
**A machine learning model** that can accurately count the number of Capuchinbird calls within an audio clip,
the project involves collecting and preprocessing audio data, and training a Convolutional Convolutional
neural network with **TensorFlow**.

# About Dataset
The data is divided into training and testing sets. Although the provided training data is sufficient to build a
decent model, you can further improve the model's performance by sourcing additional audio clips, which
can be downloaded through a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zt64NTiPbjJ4wGdaAC3AYvGQr8hst6u_/view).
